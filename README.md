## What is T5 Algorithm?

The T5 (Text-To-Text Transfer Transformer) algorithm is a powerful language model developed by Google Research. It is designed to convert various natural language processing (NLP) tasks into a unified text-to-text format, allowing it to handle a wide range of tasks with a single model. This model excels in extractive summarization, meaning it generates summaries by identifying and extracting key information from the source text.
